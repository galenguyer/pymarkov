okay i kicked them out
And Epic:  
And be sure to wishlist on Steam:  
Alright our lunch break’s over. Thanks for joining us for the Q&amp;A! Check out the trailer for @wherecardsfall here:  
Joel: geez i hope so  Sam: the graphics are a step down from blaseball but we think you’ll like it anyway
Joel: our art director josh animated all of the cards by hand, believe it or not, and then our engineer brandon translated them to be programmatic and seamless! they made magic
Sam: But for games that are actually kind of similar, our playtesters said the puzzles remind them of Portal and Stephen’s Sausage Roll while the atmosphere feels like Ico and INSIDE.
Sam: Mortal Kombat 3 Joel: Hand to hand combat
Sam &amp; Joel: The water level. RIV.  
Sam: for everyone curious about the gameplay &amp; controls, I made a video that talks about both  
Sam: Really depends on preference – the controls are very unique. Point and click adventure fans will probably prefer the mouse, platformer fans will probably prefer the controller. The PC version supports both.
Joel: it's unique on all platforms, very different feel! i'm partial to the switch version because i hate computers. also, it plays very smoothly on controller.
joel: a lot of love was put into the art of the game. the scene transitions system was a big technical challenge that was rewarding to get right. (wasn't me but still)
Sam: In Rainbows Joel: Kid A
Sam: The original seed for the idea came from the Radiohead song House of Cards. I loved how it used the idiom to make lives feel really fragile. Radiohead’s also a big inspiration for TGB – always changing their sound and reinventing themselves.
Joel: the systems of the game are incredibly simple — it's just building/collapsing cards, and character movement — but create a surprising amount of depth. it's not an easy puzzle game. the story is about growth, reflection and understanding, and the puzzles hit those notes well
Sam: It’s an authored story that leaves room for projection. There’s no dialogue in the game – the mechanics and visual design do the talking. As you move and reshape the houses of cards, they change in form and function, like a jumble of ideas flowing together.
Sam: I pitched it to ~10 million publishers and fortunately my friends at @builtbysnowman decided to take a chance on me. That’s how @thegameband got its start.
Sam: I started Where Cards Fall way back when I was in college at USC. After graduating I worked in the games industry for several years on Skylanders and Edith Finch but kept working on WCF on the side.
Hey everyone this is Sam and Joel from @thegameband. Keep asking your questions!
The interns are here
oh come on

Re-read number 4
#CLARIFICATION and another #ANNOUNCEMENT:   In the Wild Card Round, the Four Seed will play the Five, while the Top 3 Idle.   The Wild Card Series is Best of 3. Game 1 will commence one hour after the end of the regular season. 🩸⚾️
The Deck does not affect Party Time. The Cards will be drawn when the season ends.

Going forward, official team accounts are only those I follow. Only trust announcements that come from me. I promise transparency. You can trust me.
We love all of our fan clubs here on twitter, but the recent libelous allegations against me are untrue and deeply hurtful. I have been assured that I continue to have the full support of the league and will be pursuing legal action against any fans attempting to sew discontent.
Good morning #blaseball. Condolences to the Maldonado and Olive families. Hades Tigers seem to be running away with the Lawful Evil Division!
I have been informed that the incinerations will continue until morale improves. #blaseball

After pacing the league at the start of the season, Jazz Hands are trying to claw their way back to the top of Chaotic Evil
welcome to blaseball
people keep asking how it’s pronounced. blaseball
This Firefighters vs Steaks game took wayyy too long. 37 minutes and counting lol
Garages are 3 outs away from delivering the Jazz Hands their first loss of the season 👀 #blaseball
wow
 
Jazz Hands are the last remaining undefeated team in the league. Currently trailing the Spies going into the 7th
Crabs are out of the basement!
People are asking what the SHAME means. in Blaseball, games don't end when the home team takes the lead in the bottom of the final inning. The away team must finish the game haha
A #promise from the #blaseball commissioner: I will be the most transparent, accountable, and accessible commissioner in blaseball history. DMs remain open.
The Tigers and Crabs are looking to secure their first win of the season lol
What's your favorite team sound off
